Note: world editor2 is the most up to date level editor.

the principle of world editor work as follow :

the level is divided into areas, and the areas can be linked by special type of tiles called "gate".
each area has it own tiles and actors, actor can be either enemy, npc,or just a sprite (like clouds for example).
when you open the level editor you will be first into the "select tile screen",
here select an area from a tileset and go to "edit screen" by pressing the "s" key
and place it anywhere on the level. Press right-click to deselect the tile.


Move large tileset with arrows. Click any place to start a selected area, you can move the tile while dragging
to select a greater area, the first selected cell will represent the gripping point, use this to place it easily on
a level.
